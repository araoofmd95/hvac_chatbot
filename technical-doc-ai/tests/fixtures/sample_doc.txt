3.2.1 Ventilation Requirements for Carparks

The ventilation system shall provide adequate air movement to prevent accumulation of vehicle exhaust gases.

Requirements:
a) Minimum ventilation rate shall be 300 m³/hour per car space.
b) If the carpark area exceeds 2000 m², mechanical ventilation is required.
c) Maximum static pressure shall not exceed 50 Pa.
d) The total flow rate Q = n × 300 where n is the number of car spaces.

Table 3.1: Ventilation Rates by Vehicle Type
Vehicle Type    | Minimum Rate (m³/h)
Small vehicles  | 250
Standard cars   | 300  
Large vehicles  | 350

Example Calculation:
For a 6-car carpark: 6 × 300 = 1800 m³/hour total ventilation required.
